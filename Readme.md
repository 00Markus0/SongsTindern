# Songs Tindern
*Songs Tindern* was created to help open minded music fans find new music they like without a biased recommandation system getting in the way.

## Usage
The priciple is easy: once you logged in with your Spotify account (premium is required) and selected you gamemode the webapp presets **random songs** to you, which you can either **like (swipe right) or dislike (swipe left)** according to the interaction principle known from dating sites. All liked songs are saved and **can be added to playlists on your Spotify account** after the user is finished swiping. You can also see all songs you ever liked in the **history** and add songs to playlists from there. Moreover the **statistics** tab alows you to find out more about your preferances and biases. For a more varied experience we offer **four different gamemodes** that require faster decisionmaking and/or hide information to eliminate even more biases.

Currently the app is still in review by Spotify and therefore only few users, which we have to add to our Spotify developer account can use our hosted version of the app. Alternatively you can download the code and change it to use your own Spotify developer account.

The app is avaiable under: https://songs-tindern.herokuapp.com/
